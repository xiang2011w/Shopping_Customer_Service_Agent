Amazon Return Policy
Easy shopping, simple returns - that's our promise. At Amazon, we're committed to making your shopping experience as seamless and worry-fee as possible. We understand that there may be times when a purchase may not meet your expectations or your needs might change. When that happens, we make completing a return simple and convenient.

Most items can be returned for a refund or replacement/exchange within 30 days of delivery as long as they are in original or unused condition. For eligible items, you can enjoy free returns at many locations near you. For information on an item's return eligibility, please check the product detail page before placing your order. After placing an order, you can find relevant information on an item's return eligibility in your Order History.

A refund will be provided if Amazon (or the third party seller) has received the item, and determined that you are eligible for a refund. It can take up to 30 days for us to receive and process your return. In certain circumstances refund timeframes may be longer. If we need additional information about your return, we will notify you with instructions to contact Customer Service. For more information, please see our Refunds page.

Initiating a Return
To initiate a return on a item that's eligible for return, simply go to Your Orders and click on "Return Items" button next to the item. Detail instructions can be found in this video.

Third Party Seller Returns
When you order from a third-party seller that fulfills and ships their own inventory, your return is sent back to the seller instead of Amazon. Sellers must offer one of the following:

A return address within the United States where you can ship the item
A prepaid return label; or
A full refund without requesting the item be returned
If a third-party seller doesn't offer these methods to return your items, please file an A-to-z Guarantee claim. For more information about returns to sellers, please refer to Returns to Third-Party Sellers.

Sending Us Your Return
You can return most items for free at over 8,000 convenient locations, typically within a 5-mile radius of your address. Additionally, most returns do not need to be boxed or labeled. Please make sure, however, that your item is returned in original or unused condition with tags attached and hygiene seals and liners intact, and in the original manufacturer's packaging including tags, components, accessories, manuals, certificates of authenticity, and other inserts.

Please follow the return instructions for each item to receive a refund. Do not include items from separate orders in the same return.

If you have bought an item (e.g., computers, electronics) on which you've saved personal information, please erase this information completely by following manufacturer instructions.

Returning a Gift
Navigate to the Returns page, use the 17-digit order number e.g. 123-1234567-1234567 (add: "how do I find this?" hover-over link) on your packing slip that came with your item or on the digital gift receipt, to initiate a return. If you can't locate the order number, ask the gift giver. If you need an exchange or replacement, you'll need to return the gift and place a new order.

Kindle books you receive as a gift are eligible for exchange for an Amazon.com Gift Card before acceptance.
Global Store Returns
Items shipped from Amazon.com, including Amazon Resale, can be returned within 30 days of delivery, with some exceptions:

For most Amazon Global Store returns, you will be provided with a pre-paid UPS return label which allows you to return the item(s) to any UPS drop-off point located across the US. You can find your most convenient UPS location using the following link: https://www.ups.com/dropoff/?loc=en_US
Not all Global Store products are eligible for a pre-paid return. In this case, you will need to return the item at your own expense. We recommend you return the item(s) using a trackable method at the carrier of your choice.
It can take up to 25 days for an item to reach us once you return it. Once the item is received and processed at our fulfillment center, it takes 2 business days for the refund to be processed and 3-5 business days for the refund amount to show up in your account.
Amazon will automatically refund up to $20 for return postage costs on receipt of the item. If your return postage costs exceed $20, you may contact Customer Service to request a refund of the remaining postage cost. If you return a defective, damaged or incorrect item, you'll be refunded the full postage cost, as well as your Import Fees Deposit, once your return is processed.
Special Delivery Service Returns
Items delivered with "Deluxe Delivery & Unpack" and "Deluxe Delivery & Assembly" services qualify for instant return at the point of delivery. Please visit our Special Delivery Options page for more details.

Product Warranties
Please contact the manufacturer directly for product registration and warranty-related information. A manufacturer warranty may not cover used products offered on Amazon.com; review the manufacturer warranty details on the product detail page for coverage or contact the manufacturer directly.

Unintended Item(s) in My Return
If you accidentally sent the wrong item to Amazon, please contact Customer Service as soon as possible. Note that we may not be able to locate mistakenly sent items and are unable to provide compensation in these cases. Amazon does not store items sent in error and will handle (and/or dispose) such items at our discretion.

Returning Items Purchased in a Bundle
You must return all items purchased in a Bundle with Savings to receive a refund. Partial refunds are not available.

Note:

Amazon offers a convenient return service for reasonable use by our customers. Should customers abuse this service, we may adjust its availability.

For any return, Amazon may require additional information and documentation (such as a government-issued photo identification) during the processing of a return to help determine whether to provide a refund/replacement. Amazon reserves the right to take additional actions to prevent fraud or abuse (including denial of returns, refunds or exchanges, or, imposing return fees). Amazon may modify this policy at any time.
